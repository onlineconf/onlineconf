# OnlineConf

OnlineConf is an application level configuration system targeted at developers and managers of web services and applications and used to change their behavior rapidly.

OnlineConf is developed with horizontal scalability and fault tolerance in mind, and it is able to store relatively large configurations. Reading of configuration parameters by applications is done from memory mapped files organized as a constant database and it neither requires networking nor injects additional points of failure. Thanks to the index required parameters only are read from files without parsing of their whole content.

OnlineConf is developed by Mail.Ru where it is used since 2011 to configure high load projects deployed on thousands of servers.

## Features

* Configuration availability irrespective of availability of OnlineConf itself;
* Fast indexed access to parameters by applications;
* Storing a configuration structured as a tree;
* Not only text values but JSON/YAML too;
* Symbolic links to parameters (like symlinks in Unix systems);
* Conditional parameters which values depend on a hostname, datacenter or credentials of a server;
* Control panel to edit a configuration without developer, devops or system administrator skills;
* API for scripted modification of parameters;
* Access control applied to individual parameters and whole subtrees;
* Log of parameters modifications and pluggable notifications;
* [Kubernetes integration](https://github.com/onlineconf/onlineconf-csi-driver).

## Installation

### Try in Docker

Run the database, the API and the control panel:

```sh
cd admin
docker-compose up
```

The database will be initialized with the demo config, the control panel and the API will be accessible at http://localhost.

The demo shows a relatively complex case when one installation of OnlineConf is used to control multiple unrelated projects (for just one project a structure can be simpler): *gopher* and *squirrel*. Every project is deployed on its own cluster and has its own user groups.

For demonstration purposes following users are created (passwords match usernames):
* `admin` - a user with the full access (group `root`);
* `hedgehog` - a system administrator (group `sysadmin`);
* `meerkat` - a developer of the gopher project (group `gopher-developer`);
* `rabbit` - a developer of the squirrel project (group `squirrel-developer`);
* `beaver` - a manager of the squirrel project (group `squirrel-manager`).

In this demo the relation of a managed server to a project is determined by credentials with which *onlineconf-updater* connects to *onlineconf-admin* (see branch `/onlineconf/service` of the configuration, passwords match usernames).

Run the agent which updates configuration files on a target server.

```sh
cd updater
docker-compose up
```

By default *onlineconf-updater* for the project gopher is run by `docker-compose`. To run the agent for the squirrel project credentials in [docker-compose.yml](updater/docker-compose.yml) must be fixed. Generated configuration files can be found in `./updater/data` directory on the host (mounted as `/usr/local/etc/onlineconf` in the container).

Projects gopher and squirrel are intentionally configured differently. Gopher follows the way of one logically structured config which is used by all services run on a server whereas on a server of squirrel every service has its own configuration file.

### Run in production

Building, configuring and running of `onlineconf-admin` and `onlineconf-updater` are easy enough. Information on running `onlineconf-admin` can be found in [admin/docker-compose.yml](admin/docker-compose.yml), [admin/Dockerfile](admin/Dockerfile) and [admin/SPECS/onlineconf-admin.spec](admin/SPECS/onlineconf-admin.spec). For `onlineconf-updater` see files [updater/docker-compose.yml](updater/docker-compose.yml), [updater/Dockerfile](updater/Dockerfile) and [updater/SPECS/onlineconf-updater.spec](updater/SPECS/onlineconf-updater.spec).

`onlineconf-admin` can either be placed behind reverse proxy (nginx, for example) or serve static and terminate TLS by itself. Anyway TLS MUST be used in production.

If OnlineConf is used to configure applications deployed in Kubernetes then [onlineconf-csi-driver](https://github.com/onlineconf/onlineconf-csi-driver) is recommended to use instead of *onlineconf-updater*.

## Architecture

OnlineConf consists of two components: `onlineconf-admin` and `onlineconf-updater`.

### onlineconf-admin

The main component of the system. Contains the whole logic of configurations, provides the API for editing of a configuration, the API for delivering configurations to managed servers and exposes the control panel.

To store data the MySQL database is used. It is well known by system administrators and they exactly know how to configure, replicate and backup it.
Backend of the service is written in Go, frontend in TypeScript, communication between them is done using a REST API which can be used for an automation too.

### onlineconf-updater

The daemon runs on every server configured by OnlineConf. It updates local configuration files from the data received from *onlineconf-admin*. It asks *onlineconf-admin* periodically if the configuration has changed and if so then writes a new configuration to the local files in two formats: *conf* and *cdb*.

Format *conf* is historical and used from the very first versions of OnlineConf. It can be recommended for small configurations only. This format is a plain text where each line is a key-value pair.

The recommended format is *cdb*. Its support was added when it became plain what reading a configuration from plain text files requires a lot of CPU time. CDB is documented on the site of its author: http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html

The daemon is written in Go, has no dependencies and easily deployed on any system.

## Data types

* Null - a key without a value, it is equal to the absence of the key;
* Text - a text, can be multiline;
* JSON - JSON-encoded field;
* YAML - a field stored, edited and viewed as YAML. Applications will receive it transcoded to JSON to simplify usage;
* Template - a text template where other parameters, a hostname/ip of a target server or variables from `variables` section of *onlineconf-updater* configuration file can be substituted;
* Symlink - a symbolic link to another parameter similar to symlinks of Unix systems;
* Case - a conditional value, works as the switch operator;
* Various types of lists: a simple comma-separated list, *ip:port* pairs separated by a comma and *ip:ports* pairs separated by a semicolon (where ports are separated by a comma).

## Authentication

Right now two authentication methods are supported:

* `mysql` - credentials are stored in MySQL table. Table structure and password hashing method are inherited and compatible with module `mod_auth_mysql` of Apache httpd.

* `header` - authentication is performed by a reverse proxy deployed in front of *onlineconf-admin*. In case of success it adds additional HTTP header with username (and signature, optionally).

## Authorization

Any parameter of the tree can be configured to be readable and writable by a specific group of users. Access rights are inherited by children parameters from the parent. Any user who can edit a parameter can delegate an access to another group of users.

The system has the special group `root` which has additional capabilities such as a management of groups of users.

## The special parameters

The configuration tree of OnlineConf has the special branch `/onlineconf`. It is used to configure the behavior of OnlineConf itself and makes some interesting things possible.

### /onlineconf/module

`/onlineconf/module` is the most important branch of the tree. It is the starting point of all configurations sent to managed servers. Every child of this parameter represents a separate configuration file with the whole subtree as its content.

In the simplest case this node has exactly one child parameter `/onlineconf/module/TREE` which contains a symlink to the root of the tree. This way all managed servers receive files `/usr/local/etc/onlineconf/TREE.{cdb,conf}` containing the whole configuration tree. But more interesting cases are possible.

For example, the parameter can contain a *case* value which depending on a group of a managed server contains symlink to different subtrees. In this case managed servers from different groups will receive different configurations. This is useful to manage several projects using one installation of OnlineConf.

If several services are run on one managed server and they must have their own configuration files then `/onlineconf/module` can contain several children one for each service.

Values of parameters `/onlineconf/module` and `/onlineconf/module/${modulename}` are used by *onlineconf-updater* to customize a generation of configuration files. `/onlineconf/module` is used to configure a default behavior used for all modules whereas `/onlineconf/module/${modulename}` for a `${modulename}` only. The value must be of YAML or JSON type and contain a map of parameters.
Right now the only one parameter is supported - `delimiter`. It is used to configure a delimiter used in names of configuration parameters. For new installations of OnlineConf it is highly recommended to configure it explicitly (in `/onlineconf/module`), in the other case the compatibility mode will be used in which the delimiter `/` will be used for the module `TREE` and the delimiter `.` for other modules.

### /onlineconf/service

`/onlineconf/service` contains a tree of accounts which are used by *onlineconf-updater* to authorize in *onlineconf-admin*. It also can be used as a condition in a *case*. The name of a parameter is the name of a user (or its last chunk), the value is password's SHA256. To be protected from the rainbow table attacks a password MUST be a long random string (16 characters at least).
Nested services inherit configurations from their parents allowing to override some parameters by using more specific *cases*.
A username of a nested service is a path without `/onlineconf/service/` prefix, for example, `gopher/alpha`.

### /onlineconf/group

`/onlineconf/group` groups managed servers by name. The name of a parameter is the name of a group, the value is a *glob* (similar to glob used in `bash`) of hostnames belonging to this group. Syntax of the used glob flavor is described here: https://github.com/gobwas/glob

`/onlineconf/group/priority` - a list of the groups in descending order. By default the groups are sorted alphabetically. All explicitly unspecified groups are appended to the end of the list or instead of `*` placeholder if presented. Priorities are useful in the case when one server belongs to several groups for which a parameter has different values.

### /onlineconf/datacenter

`/onlineconf/datacenter` groups servers by datacenter. The name of a child parameter is the name of a datacenter, the value can either be of `Null` type or a comma-separated list of networks of `Text` or `List` types. In the first case datacenter name will be received from *onlineconf-updater* (`datacenter` parameter in its `onlineconf.yaml` config), in the second case it will be calculated using IP address *onlineconf-updater* connected from.

### /onlineconf/suspended

`/onlineconf/suspended` suspends sending of configurations to managed servers if the value is true (the type is not `Null` and the value is not `""` and not `"0"`). Can be used to edit multiple parameters in one transaction. The beginning of a transaction is setting the parameter to true, the end - to false. It is also useful to test dangerous configuration modifications on a small subset of managed servers.

### /onlineconf/ephemeral-ip

`/onlineconf/ephemeral-ip` contains a list of networks where IP addresses are assigned dynamically and are valid only during a service lifetime (in Kubernetes cluster, for example). Reverse DNS query and monitoring are skipped for these networks.

### /onlineconf/ui/avatar

`/onlineconf/ui/avatar` contains a configuration of avatars displayed in the OnlineConf UI in JSON or YAML format with the following schema:
* `uri` - an avatar URI base, `/` and a username will be appended to it to form a URI;
* `domain` - a domain users belongs to, if present then it will be appended to usernames after `@`;
* `gravatar` - if true then a username will be hashed using MD5 before appending to a base URI;
* `rename` - `map[string]string`, a dictionary of replacements of usernames to use in avatar URIs;
* `link` - a configuration object of a link to a user profile:
  * `uri` - a user profile URI base, `/` and a username will be appended to it to form a URI;
  * `rename` - `map[string]string`, a dictionary of replacements of usernames to use in user profile URIs;

Symlinks in this parameter are intentionally not supported. Only JSON and YAML types are allowed.
A value of the parameter will be implicitly readable by all users through `/ui-config` API method.

### /onlineconf/botapi/bot

Direct children of `/onlineconf/botapi/bot` are users of the server-server API of OnlineConf. Names of children parameters are usernames, values are SHA256-encrypted passwords (MUST contain random 16+ characters long strings). User parameters can contain subparameter `scopes` (`/onlineconf/botapi/bot/*/scopes`) of type List which is used to allow these users access to various parts of the API.

## Reading a configuration from an application

Several languages already have libraries to work with configuration files: [Go](https://github.com/onlineconf/onlineconf-go), [Swift](https://github.com/onlineconf/onlineconf-swift), [Perl](https://github.com/onlineconf/onlineconf-perl), [Python](https://github.com/onlineconf/onlineconf-python) and [Node.js](https://github.com/onlineconf/onlineconf-nodejs).

For all other languages which have libraries to read CDB files it is quite simple, too. The algorithm is following:

* If CDB file is not opened yet then open it for reading, the file will be `mmap`ed to the memory, save its `mtime`. In other case compare saved `mtime` with the time of the file on a disk and if it doesn't match then reopen the file and drop caches of deserialized JSONs.
* Read the key by a parameter name. The first byte of the value is the type identifer: `s` for a string and `j` for a JSON. The remaining bytes contain the value of the parameter itself.
* If the value is a string then return a copy, if a JSON then deserialize it to a structure, cache and return.

## Common recommendations

Due to symlinks and cases OnlineConf is very flexible. During the time of using the system in Mail.Ru we found some tree organization rules useful, maybe not only for us:

* *Place parameters in the tree depending on their logic not on a required location in configuration files.* Parameters are better to be grouped in the tree logically, it improves readability and simplifies access rights delegation. Symlinks can be used to properly place parameters in configuration files. This is especially useful for parameters which are used in several subsystems.

* *Top level elements represent projects. Every project has its own chroot.* `/onlineconf/module` contains case of symlinks pointing for every project to its own `/onlineconf/chroot/${projectname}`. Every `/onlineconf/chroot/${projectname}/TREE/${projectname}` is a symlink pointing to `/${projectname}`. This way each project has its own configuration while paths to parameters on managed servers and in the configuration tree are the same.

* *Separate infrastructure.* Parameters supposed to be managed by system administrators (addresses of databases and services, credentials, tokens an so on) are stored separately in `/infrastructure` hierarchy. This hierarchy is allowed to be read and written by system administrators only, is not used directly anywhere, only through symlinks in appropriate places in a logical hierarchy of projects.

## BotAPI

Besides the client-server API which is used by the UI OnlineConf has the server-server API which can be used by various scripts and daemons to perform user-specific operations.

BotAPI requires the basic authentication which is configured using `/onlineconf/botapi/bot` parameters (see above).

### GET /notification/

Returns `limit` notifications starting from the next after `lastID`.
If there are no notifications and `wait` query parameter is provided then waits for maximum `wait` seconds until a new notification arrives.
If `limit=0` then the method just returns the current `lastID`.

Scope `notifications` is required to access this method.
